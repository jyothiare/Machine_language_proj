    "__1.Describe a data project you worked on recently.__\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the recent project that I worked on was data visualization with Tableau. I had to select a dataset and create a story  to help visualize and predict trends. I have selected the airlines dataset from DOT. The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights are available for the public. I have downloaded the raw data for the year 2016 for all the airlines for the tristate area airports EWR,PHL and JFK.I cleaned the CSV files data by removing all the diverted flight information. I have also downloaded the longitude and lattitude for all the airports as csv files and joined with the ONTIME Performance table .\n",
    "I live in the Tristate area and thought this should be an useful visualization for any one in Tristate area looking to minmize the probablity of a delayed flight. I started by trying to find out how many flights are on time or not for each airport? If the flight was not on time what was the status ? Was it delayed ,Cancelled or diverted? From this I found when a flight was not on time most of the time it is because of a delayed arrival flight. The next step was to drill down to see how each airline carrier measured in terms of flight delays for both Arrivals and Departures. The next step was to find out how Arrival and Departure delays are effected by a destination ? I also wanted to see if I am flying out or flying in which day of the week would minimize my probability of a delay. To represent all of these I considered different types of graphs but with the multiple categories and sub categories I had I found bar charts worked the best. But I also wanted to show a geographical representation of each airport's domestic arrivals and dipartures by carriers and volume. So I also added the geographical maps with arrival and destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I shared my first revised version one of my friend asked Can I know what caused the delays of these flights? Is it the weather at fault or the carrier etc. As this was also one of my original questions but missed in incorporating the visulization I choose pie charts to do that and added on two more screens to depict that. I think the pie chart gives the readability at a glance that weather is a very small part of the delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a very informative project with the help of the excellent visualizations in Tableau it was very easy to observe the trends and predict the delays for the future based on airport,airlines and destination.\n",
